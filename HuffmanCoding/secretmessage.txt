Hey Duncan,

It was great having you for CSE 143 this quarter. Sorry I haven't been able to attend every
section this quarter (I've been busy with Capstone and what not this quarter so it was a bit stressful).
Anyways, this assignment was a bit of a pain haha hence my reason for turning it in late. Anyways, with all
that aside, you were a great TA, and I've been meaning to ask you if you went to Mount Si High School. I
think I might have known your brother, Connor. That, and I believe you were a valedictorian for Mount Si,
(congrats for that btw). Anyways, thanks for being my TA and maybe I'll see you around UW.
